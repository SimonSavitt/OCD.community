<br><br>Hi everyone! I'm still working on the basic setup of this website.
<br>If you have any questions, feel free to email me at <simonsavitt@gmail.com>.
<br>You can apply to become an [OCDvocate](https://iocdf.org/get-involved/ocdvocate/)!
<br><br>This is a very rudimentary example of a list of OCD advocates:

| Name            | Website                          | Twitter                                                 | Instagram                                                         |

<br>I would like to organize a list of support groups as well!
<br>And eventually, even more categorized listings of resources about OCD!
<br>I'm still figuring out the web development aspect of this, but I promise the end result will look much better! If you can offer any advice on that front, please send me an e-mail!
