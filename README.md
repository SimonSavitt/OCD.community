<br><br>Hi everyone! I'm still working on the basic setup of this website.
<br>If you have any questions, feel free to email me at <simonsavitt@gmail.com>.
<br>You can apply to become an [OCDvocate](https://iocdf.org/get-involved/ocdvocate/)!
<br><br>This is a very rudimentary example of a list of OCD advocates:

<br><br>I would like to organize a list of support groups as well!
<br>And eventually, even more categorized listings of resources about OCD!
